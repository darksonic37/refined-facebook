# Refined Facebook

A Chrome extension that enforces the [mobile version of Facebook](https://m.facebook.com), which consumes very little resources, loads really fast and is **much less distracting**. Inspired by [Refined Wikipedia](https://github.com/ismamz/refined-wikipedia).

## Install

I'm too cheap to pay the developer signup fee on the Chrome Web Store. You can install the extension by cloning the repository and loading it manually.

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked extension**
4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository
5. Select the `src/` directory
